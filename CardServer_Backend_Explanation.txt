Backend Server Explanation

This is a Node.js and Express backend server setup for a project called CardServer.

1. Project Structure:
   - app.js: The main file that initializes and configures the Express server.
   - config/: Contains configuration files, such as database connection setup.
   - auth/: Manages authentication and authorization logic, including JWT token generation and verification.
   - cards/: Likely handles card-related routes, controllers, and services.
   - DB/: Contains any database-related files, such as models or migration scripts.
   - helpers/: Helper functions that can be used across different parts of the application.
   - logger/: Handles logging of requests or errors, potentially using a library like Winston.
   - middlewares/: Contains custom middleware functions, such as error handling, authentication checks, etc.
   - router/: Main routing logic, potentially bringing together different route files.
   - users/: Manages user-related operations like registration, login, and profile management.
   - utils/: Utility functions or constants used across the application.

2. Important Files:
   - package.json: Lists the dependencies and scripts for the project. Running 'npm install' will install all required dependencies.
   - .env (not included in the project due to .gitignore): This file should contain environment variables, such as JWT_SECRET for token-based authentication.

3. Authentication:
   - The server uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. A JWT secret (JWT_SECRET) is required in the .env file for token signing and verification.
   - Tokens are generated in auth/providers/jwt.js and are used to secure routes that require authentication.

4. How to Run the Server:
   - Step 1: Make sure to install all dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
   - Step 2: Create a `.env` file in the root directory with environment variables like `JWT_SECRET`.
   - Step 3: Start the server with `npm start` or another specified command.

5. API Endpoints:
   - The server has several endpoints related to users, authentication, and cards. You can test them using a tool like Postman.
   - Ensure that you are passing the correct headers, body parameters, and authentication tokens as required by each endpoint.

6. Error Handling:
   - The server has middleware in place for error handling, ensuring that errors are logged and proper responses are sent to the client.
